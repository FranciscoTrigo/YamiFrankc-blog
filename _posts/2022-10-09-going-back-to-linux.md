I used to use Arch Linux as my daily driver OS many years ago (around 2010, maybe), back when I was around 15 years old, this was on a Acer laptop and I used to spend all day looking around and configuring CLI programs and tiling window managers (ratpoison was one of my favorites). At some point I replaced the laptop with a desktop computer and for some reason I never got around to install Linux on it or any other main computer I used since then, its been more than 10 years! Since then I've installed and used Linux on the Raspberry Pi and on servers, but never as a main OS.

And I want to change that now. I have a Lenoxo Thinkpad X1 Carbon that is a few years old but that I use almost daily and that I take with me when I travel, I think its the perfect candidate for this experiment. I did not replace the Windows it came with, rather, I replaced the SSD and did a clean install on it. If I ever need that Windows back I can just pop that drive back in in a few minutes. 

This time I went with the Manjaro distribution, and more specifically the Sway community edition. This distro comes prepackaged with a few programs what I was going to install anyway (like FireFox), but more importantly it comes with Sway ready to go. Sway is a tiling window manager for Wayland.
