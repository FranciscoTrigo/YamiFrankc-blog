# My Ergodox

For a number of years now (I started maybe in 2017) I have been using an ergonomic split keyboard of open source design, the [Ergodox](https://www.ergodox.io/). You can either build it yourself from scratch, build it from parts or buy a completed working keyboard from a company or an independent builder. I have two, an [Infinity](https://drop.com/buy/infinity-ergodox) and an [Ergodox-EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/).
