# My Ergodox

For a number of years now (I started maybe in 2017) I have been using an ergonomic split keyboard of open source design, the [Ergodox](https://www.ergodox.io/). You can either build it yourself from scratch, build it from parts or buy a completed working keyboard from a company or an independent builder. I have two, an [Infinity](https://drop.com/buy/infinity-ergodox) and an [Ergodox-EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/).

While the ergonomics and coolness factor of it being split (thats the reason I got it in the first place!) are pretty nifty, the best feature by a longo shot is that it is completely customizable, mine uses the open source firmware [QMK](https://qmk.fm/), I'm not going to talk too much about what QMK is or how to use use it, you just need to know its a very configurable firmware for keyboards that is coded in C, and its compatible with a huge number of [different keyboards](https://qmk.fm/keyboards/).

I've been feeling really good using it and it was easy to adapt to the layout, altought I still don't find a good spot to place the right half, my right hand never hurts but its not very confortable either, I still have to find the perfect spot for it.

## My layout

My custom layout is not very adventurous, its mostly just normal Qwerty, with a couple modifications to make it more streamlined to what I do in my day to day. You can see it here:
